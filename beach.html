                <p>The islands offer a precious heritage of ecology and culture. 
                    The underwater view at Lakshadweep is kaleidoscopic and breathtaking. 
                    The lagoon offers excellent potential for water sports like swimming, 
                    wind-surfing, diving, snorkeling and kayaking.
                    Each island is fringed by snow white coral sands. The crystal clear water and the abundant 
                    marine life enhance the beauty of these islands.

              <h2>Kizhunna Ezhara beach, Kerala</h2>
              <p>Kannur coastal belt has some fine beaches. At Kizhunna Ezhara, 12 Kilometers from Kannur town,
                crimson sands meet gentle waves to form an impressive beach strip.

                Crimson cliffs and black rocks have teamed up to border the ends of beach crescents. 
                People get absorbed in the protective feel of shallow natural coves, as mild surf keeps on 
                socking sand and rocks at the seaside. 
                <br> 
                Here, in the evening, Kathakali is performed to keep
                the tourists entertained. It is a great tourist attraction, especially
                for people who want to spend some time far awar from the busy
                technical world.

              <h2>Kakolem Beach, Goa</h2>
              <p> The breathtakingly beautiful, fantastical view opens eyes of everyone 
                who is coming here for quite cozy rest from the nearby hill. From the rock, 
                which is placed right in the Beach, a cool stream flows. Its sprays are 
                showered down through slope to the shore before falling into the sea.<br> 
                Along with the soft brown sand and crystal-clear water, the presence of 
                2 waterfalls is the key highlight of this beach. The first waterfall is 
                at the main beach, which flows down the hillside and joins the Sea 
                at the end. One can climb a little to reach the freshwater.
